## Plan on improving the project

I would like to improve the aesthetic look of the recipes, form, and menu page. Compared to the design of the header section, those sections lacks a slight flare when it comes to aesthetic.

I would improve the layout on the recipes section by possibly adding an animation to create a more interactive feel when selecting a video.

The book a table section and the menu section would both benefit from a simliar image as the library coffeeshop header image. This would create an ongoing theme that would be appealing to users.

Additional animated blocks or images would add more interaction and life to the page as well.

Nitpicking aside, it was an extremely fun project to work on and I can't wait to get into more complicated forms of coding!
